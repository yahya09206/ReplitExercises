HTTP is the protocol that governs communications between servers and web clients (i.e. browsers). Part of the protocol includes a status code returned by the server to tell the browser the status of its most recent page request. Some of the codes and their meanings are listed below:
Given an int variable status write a switch statement to display the status code message. If an invalid status code is entered display Invalid status code!
